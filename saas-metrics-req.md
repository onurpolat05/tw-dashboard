Here are the metrics that can be included while preparing a past one-year financial analysis for e-commerce SaaS platforms, based on the sources and your previous queries:

Revenue Metrics:

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): This is the lifeblood of a SaaS business, indicating the predictable revenue generated each month from subscriptions. Track new MRR, churned MRR, and total MRR [1-3].
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): This metric provides an annualized view of your MRR, useful for long-term planning and valuation [1, 2, 4, 5].
Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): This metric reveals the average revenue generated from each customer, helping assess pricing strategies and customer segmentation [4, 6, 7].
Revenue Growth Rate (RGR): Track the percentage change in revenue from one period to another to understand the pace of your growth [8].
Net Revenue Retention (NRR): This metric measures the ability to retain and expand revenue from existing customers, accounting for upsells, cross-sells, and churn. A high NRR indicates a strong “land and expand” strategy [9].
Expansion Revenue: Track the additional revenue generated from existing customers through upgrades, add-ons, or increased usage [5, 9, 10].
Customer Metrics:

Customer Churn Rate: This indicates the rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions. A high churn rate can signal problems with your product, pricing, or customer support [5, 6, 11-14].
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): This metric represents the total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with your company. It's crucial for understanding long-term profitability and the effectiveness of your customer acquisition strategies [7, 8, 11, 15, 16].
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): This reflects the average cost of acquiring a new customer. Understanding your CAC is essential for determining the efficiency of your marketing and sales efforts [7, 8, 13, 15, 16].
LTV to CAC Ratio: This ratio measures the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring them. A healthy LTV to CAC ratio indicates sustainable growth [7, 8, 16].
CAC Payback Period: This metric measures how long it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a customer. Understanding your payback period is essential for cash flow management [13, 16].
Operational Metrics:

Gross Burn Rate: The total amount of cash spent each month, providing a broad view of your spending habits [8].
Net Burn Rate: Reflects the monthly net cash loss, taking revenue into account [8].
Runway: Indicates how long your company can operate with its current cash reserves [8, 17].
Active Users: Track the number of users actively engaging with your platform to assess product stickiness and user engagement. [18]
Additional Metrics:

Cohort Analysis: This involves grouping customers based on shared characteristics (e.g., signup date) to analyze their behavior over time. Cohort analysis can reveal patterns in retention, churn, and expansion, providing insights for targeted improvements. [19, 20]
Conversion Rates: Track conversion rates at each stage of your sales funnel (from website visits to free trials to paid subscriptions) to identify areas for optimization [21, 22].
Sales Pipeline Metrics: Monitor the number of leads generated, conversion rates, average deal size, and other sales activities to forecast future revenue and identify potential bottlenecks [23].
Product Usage Metrics: Analyze data on feature adoption, user engagement, and in-app behavior to understand how your product is being used and identify areas for improvement [19, 24].
Financial Statements and Reporting:

Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement: This statement summarizes your revenues, costs, and expenses over a period, providing a clear picture of your profitability. [23, 25-28]
Cash Flow Statement: This statement tracks the movement of cash in and out of your business, helping you manage your liquidity and ensure you have sufficient funds to operate. [25, 27-29]
Balance Sheet: This financial statement provides a snapshot of your company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a particular point in time. [25, 26]
Key Considerations:

Industry Benchmarks: Compare your metrics to industry averages and benchmarks to assess your company’s performance relative to competitors. [30, 31]
Focus on Actionable Metrics: Select metrics that can be used to make informed decisions and drive improvement.
Consistency in Tracking and Reporting: Ensure you're consistently tracking your metrics over time using the same definitions and calculations to maintain data integrity.
Remember, the goal of financial analysis is to gain insights into your business performance and identify opportunities for growth and improvement. By carefully selecting and analyzing the relevant metrics, you can make informed decisions that drive your e-commerce SaaS platform toward success.
